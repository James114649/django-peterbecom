    This site is an experiment with 3 different versions of displaying a bunch
    of content. <b>Ideally as fast as possible</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Performance is a mix of actual <b>rendering speed</b> (which very much depends on
    "quirks" in the browser) and <b>perceived speed</b>. <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Generally, you have a choice between generating a blob of HTML on the server
    and sending that, or using the server just to send a skeleton framework and
    data in some pure format (e.g. JSON).
  </p>
  <p>
    This experiment does NOT recommend a particular approach over another.
    Having these different versions helps to make you aware of the
    <b>characteristics of performance</b> and what it means when you make a
    realistic choice in how you develop your site.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can alternatively call the three versions:
    <ol>
      <li>Thin client</li>
      <li>Half-and-half client</li>
      <li>Fat client</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    All content (HTML, JSON) is served straight out of memcache, with a tiny
    shim of Python in Django to make that happen.<br>

<h3>Three Different Versions</h3>
<h4>
  1. <a href="{{ url('ajaxornot:view1') }}">Load it all with the HTML template
    rendered on the server</a>
</h4>
<p class="pros-and-cons">
  <b>Pros</b>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fast rendering</li>
  <li>No need to serialize to and from JSON</li>
  <li>Less requests</li>
  <li>No SEO concerns</li>
</ul>

<p class="pros-and-cons">
  <b>Cons</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Potentially fat HTML documents take a long time to download before something appears on the screen</li>
    <li>Hard to put the HTML in a dumb and fast cache (e.g. CDN or Varnish)</li>
    <li>You're going to need to do some business logic in templates and some in Javascript</li>
    <li>Hard to cache globally</li>
    <li>Making a fast rendering server isn't always easy</li>
  </ul>

<h4>
  2. <a href="{{ url('ajaxornot:view2') }}">Load a "skeleton" of HTML.
  Then asynchronously load in the data, in HTML, with AJAX</a>
</h4>
<p class="pros-and-cons">
  <b>Pros</b>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Initial HTML document is small and quick to render something on the screen</li>
  <!-- <li>JSON weighs less than HTML</li> -->
  <li>HTML document skeleton can be dumb and highly cached for every user</li>
  <li>Possibly to cache skeleton globally and have bulk data vary per user</li>
</ul>
<p class="pros-and-cons">
  <b>Cons</b>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Slower rendering</li>
  <li>Human eyes will notice the "flicker" between skeleton loading and the bulk of the data coming in</li>
  <li>More requests</li>
  <li>More CPU work needed by the browser</li>
  <li>Might need a "loading animation" widget to indicate that more is to come</li>
</ul>

<h4>
  3. <a href="{{ url('ajaxornot:view3') }}">Use a Javascript framework and load
    all content with AJAX as JSON</a>
</h4>
<p class="pros-and-cons">
  <b>Pros</b>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Initial HTML document is small and quick to render something on the screen</li>
  <li>Since you'll have the data as a model you can do things like filter and change sort
    without needing to re-render things on the server</li>
  <!-- <li>JSON weighs less than HTML</li> -->
  <li>HTML document skeleton can be dumb and highly cached for every user</li>
  <li>The initial skeleton can be kept when loading different data (e.g. <code>pushState</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p class="pros-and-cons">
  <b>Cons</b>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Much slower rendering</li>
  <li>Human eyes will notice the "flicker" between skeleton loading and the bulk of the data coming in</li>
  <li>More requests</li>
  <li>Much more CPU work needed by the browser</li>
  <li>The browser has to repaint the column spacing as more table rows are added</li>
</ul>

<h3>Optimization Attempts</h3>

<p>
  If you care about performance, it wouldn't be fair to leave the techniques
  completely un-optimized. Let's compare some different approaches that are
  realistic options of optimization.
</p>

<h4>
  1. <a href="{{ url('ajaxornot:view4') }}">Include the bulk data as a JSON
    string inside the server rendered page</a>
</h4>
<p class="pros-and-cons">
  <b>Pros</b>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Slightly smaller payload to transfer. 466Kb vs. 178Kb, but 58Kb vs. 49Kb when gzipped</li>
  <li>All rendering logic in the browser already. Good if you pull in more data later</li>
</ul>
<p class="pros-and-cons">
  <b>Cons</b>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Some SEO concerns</li>
  <li>Requires inline Javascript which can have security risks</li>
  <li>If you use Gzip, actually very little difference</li>
</ul>

<h4>
  2. <a href="{{ url('ajaxornot:view5') }}">Content "below the fold" loaded
    asynchronously later</a>
</h4>
<p class="pros-and-cons">
  <b>Pros</b>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Very fast to get enough perceived content first.</li>
  <li>Remaining content keeps the brower busy whilst the user is reading and not waiting.</li>
</ul>
<p class="pros-and-cons">
  <b>Cons</b>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Can completely break ability to do client-side filtering or sorting until
    all data has loaded.</li>
  <li>The scrollbar might act strange as it changes since it shrinks in size
    when more content comes in</li>
  <li>If the column widths need to be readjusted it might flicker the content
  above the fold</li>
</ul>

<h3>Crazy Hybrids</h3>

<p>
  Here we have examples where we want to experiment. Considering that
  generally the objective is to show data to the user as soon as follows,
  one pattern is to store the data in the browser's persistent memory.
  E.g. <code>localStorage</code> or <code>IndexedDB</code><br>
  This has the advantage, that for repeated visits you can draw from
  something much physically nearer and show that instead of having to
  wait for the network. Obviously, data gets old in the browser so you'll
  have to combine this such that you show the "cached" stuff first
  <b>until</b> the network request has finished.
</p>

<p>
  In these experiments, when you load them the very first time it just populates
  the local storage mechanism, whatever that might be, and asks you
  to refresh the page. In a production application, you'd want to
  "fail gracefully" and be patient that first time and render once the
  network request has finished.<br>
  Also, in a production application, you probably want to first and foremost
  display what you have in your local storage mechanism immediately and once
  the network request finishes, you update the page with the latest and
  greatest data from the server.<br>
  Remember, this is an experimental playground. The point is to get a feel
  for how fast it can render with various techniques.
</p>

<h4>
  1. <a href="{{ url('ajaxornot:view7a') }}">Store a local copy in Lovefield and render with React</a>
</h4>
<p>
  <b>Notes</b>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://google.github.io/lovefield/">Lovefield</a>
    is a very advanced local storage (abstraction of <code>IndexedDB</code>)
     so you can
    later do more advanced queries and you can do writes without
    updating one enormous big blob.</li>
  <li>In my testing (ie. on my Macbook, Firefox 43) it takes almost half a
    second to extract approximated 1,000 records from <code>IndexedDB</code>
    using Lovefield.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
  2. <a href="{{ url('ajaxornot:view7b') }}">Store a local copy in <code>localStorage</code> and render with React</a>
</h4>
<p>
  <b>Notes</b>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Storing and retrieving a big JSON blob in <code>localStorage</code>
    is fast but inefficient if you intend to do many inserts, queries, updates
  etc on the data.</li>
  <li>In my testing (ie. on my Macbook, Firefox 43) it takes only 1-2 milliseconds
    to extract and parse the stored JSON from my <code>localStorage</code></li>
</ul>


<h3>Discussion, Thoughts, Conclusion</h3>
<div class="well">
  <p>
    Clearly, by clicking around on these versions it's apparent that <b>the more
    HTML you generate on the server the better. In terms of performance.</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Websites that are useful and easy to use can be perceived to be faster.
    A "fat client" web page with fancy features that can load more
    content/functionality almost instantly is more useful.
  </p>
  <p>
    If your site has a high bounce rate and you want happy once-in-a-while
    visitors, then render as much as you possibly can on the server.<br>
    If you expect your users to stick around and perform <b>multiple tasks,
    pay the upfront cost and go for a fat client.</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Everything has a <b>"It depends"</b> label on it.
